# Tasty-Bites-rebuild
The purpose of this project is to develop a digital solution in the form of an app to address several operational challenges faced by Tasty Bytes, a small restaurant. The challenges include inefficient inventory tracking, difficulty in anticipating busy periods, and decreased efficiency, which lead to food waste, missed sales opportunities, and reduced customer satisfaction. By providing real-time data on inventory levels, sales trends, and customer traffic, the app will help workers make informed decisions to optimize their workflow, reduce waste, and increase profitability. This will result in enhanced efficiency, decreased waste, improved customer satisfaction, and increased competitiveness in a challenging market. Research studies and reports have identified inaccurate inventory tracking and ineffective inventory management as common problems in the restaurant industry, leading to food waste and decreased profitability, making the development of this app a critical step for Tasty Bytes to overcome these challenges.
